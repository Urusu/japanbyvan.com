>3日間の旅行で車をお借りしました。非常に早い対応で、2-3回の質問でしたが毎回数時間以内での回答をいただきました。車内も清潔で特にモバイルルーターがとてもありがたかったです。人柄もとても丁寧で今回だけでなく次回のチャンスがあればお願いしたいと思います。 I rent the car for 3 days. Their reply was very quick. I asked several and I received their replies within 1-3 hours. Inside the car was clean and tidy. Free WIFI access with mobile router was very useful in our trip. The owner was nice and kind. If I have a chance to travel with a ban I would rent the car from her again.
