>We’re very glad to have met Lisa and Urs, they are great people! They were flexible with pick-up time and location, helped us plan our trip and had some very helpful recommendations. Plus, their van is better equipped than many rental apartments so we had absolutely nothing to worry about. Thank you guys so much – and see you next time!
