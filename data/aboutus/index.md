A Japanese-Swiss/Swiss couple based near Lake Biwa in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture - just 11km outside of Kyoto city. Passionate about traveling at our own pace and in love with the beauty & rich culture of Japan. We started traveling by van in Japan in 2015 and since then, we keep exploring famous sights as well as remote areas. 
After finishing a first remodeling of our Bongo Friendee in march 2018, we obtained the official rental car license and spent the summer working on our second van. We're full of ideas and look forward to start our next van conversion in 2019.

We love to share our passion with you and are happy to assist you before and during your trip.
