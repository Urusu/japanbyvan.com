## Who we are

A Japanese-Swiss/ Swiss couple based near Lake Biwa in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture- just 11km outside of Kyoto city. Passionate about traveling the world in our own pace and in love with the beauty&rich culture of Japan, we started traveling by (rental) van in Japan in 2015 and since then, we keep exploring famous sights as well as remote areas in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. 
After finishing a first small remodeling of our Bongo Friendee in march 2018, we obtained the official rental car license and spent the summer working on our second van (Toyota Hiace). We're full of ideas and look forward to starting our next van conversion in 2019.

We just love to share our passion with you and are happy to assist you before and during your trip.
