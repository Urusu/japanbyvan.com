## Who we are

A half Swiss/half Japanese/Swiss couple based near Lake Biwa in Otsu, Shiga Prefecture- just 11km outside of Kyoto city. Passionate about traveling the world in our own pace and in love with the rich culture&beauty of Japan, we started traveling by van in Japan 2015 and since then, we keep exploring famous sights as well as remote areas in Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. After finishing a first small remodeling of Bongo Friendee in March, we obtained the official rental car license and spent the summer working on our second van: Toyota Hiace aka "Broccoli" :-)

We just love to share our passion with you and are happy to assist you before and during your trip.
