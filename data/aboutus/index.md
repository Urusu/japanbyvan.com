A Japanese-Swiss/Swiss couple based in Osaka City.  Being completely self-refurbished and built with love, our vans are unique and cater for the needs of any kind of van traveler.
This is why our fleet is growing slowly, but we are full of ideas and looking forward to breathing new life into many more vans to come :-)  
We are enthusiastic (van)travelers ourselves and love to explore this beautiful country while testing our vans and finding new routes, hot springs and camp spots.

Contact us if you have any questions. We look forward to meeting you soon in Japan!
