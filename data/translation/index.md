## Drivers license translation service

International Driving Permits **based on the 1949 Geneva Road Convention are required to drive legally in Japan. Belgium, France, Germany, Monaco, Slovenia, Switzerland and Taiwan do not issue permits based on the 1949 Geneva Convention**, but instead have a **separate agreement** that allows drivers from these countries to drive in Japan for up to one year with an official Japanese translation of their driverâ€™s license. The translation has to be obtained **before** pick-up.

Translations can be obtained from your country's embassy or consulate in Japan or from the **Japan Automobile Federation** (JAF). Please see details on the [official website](http://www.jaf.or.jp/e/translation/switch.htm) of the JAF.

**We can do this for you!**

If you rent with us or just want to have the translation done through us, we can help you out.
We just need a copy of your drivers license and we do the rest.
